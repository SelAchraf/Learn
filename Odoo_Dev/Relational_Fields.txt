===================================================== Relational Fields =====================================================

------------------ Many2one ------------------

# Syntax : field_id = fields.Many2one(comodel_name='model_name')

# It create a field_id column and a fkey constraint in the current model table

------------------ One2many ------------------

# Syntax : field_ids = fields.One2many(comodel_name='model_name', inverse_name='field_id')

# The field_ids is related with the inverse_name field in the comodel_name model

# We can delete or add a new value for the field_ids

------------------ Many2many ------------------

# Syntax : field_ids = fields.Many2many(comodel_name='model_name')

# It create a new table (relational table) with two columns (the primary key of each model table)

-----------------------------------------------

# We add the "widget="many2many_tags" attribute to the relational field (One2many or Many2many) in the form view to be able to select or create a new value for it
                  
# We can add <tree string="Caption" create="true" delete="true" edit="true">
                  <field name="name"/>
             </tree>
  with a specific fields inside the relational filed (One2many or Many2many) in the form view but when we want to add a new value to it we must create it 
  (we can't select it from the existing values)
